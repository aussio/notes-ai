- [x] Set up development workflow (linting, type-checking, git hooks)
- [x] Create core types and interfaces
- [ ] Set up Dexie database class
- [ ] Set up basic layout components
- [ ] Create simple note context with async operations

### Basic CRUD

- [ ] Note creation functionality
- [ ] Simple text editor (textarea)
- [ ] Note listing component
- [ ] Delete functionality

### Core Features

- [ ] Auto-save implementation
- [ ] Basic local text search
- [ ] Polish and testing

## 🤖 AI Development Workflow

### Quality Assurance Protocol

- **Before each commit**: Run `npm run check-all` to verify all quality checks pass
- **Ask before committing**: Always confirm with user before running `git commit`
- **Check off completed tasks**: Update plan.md checkboxes as features are completed
- **Test immediately**: Run relevant tests after implementing new features

### Commit Guidelines

- **Small, focused commits**: Each commit should represent one logical change
- **Descriptive messages**: Clear commit messages describing what was implemented
- **Quality gates**: Pre-commit hooks automatically run linting, formatting, and tests
- **User confirmation**: Ask "Ready to commit these changes?" before proceeding

### Progress Tracking

- **Update checkboxes**: Mark completed items as [x] in plan.md
- **Document decisions**: Update technical decisions section when architecture changes
- **Note blockers**: Clearly communicate any issues or dependencies

### Development Cycle

1. **Implement feature**: Write code following our established patterns
2. **Run quality checks**: `npm run check-all` to verify everything works
3. **Update plan**: Check off completed items in plan.md
4. **Ask user**: "Ready to commit [description of changes]?"
5. **Commit**: Only after user approval

## 🔧 Development Workflow & Quality

### Automated Quality Checks

- **ESLint**: Run on every file change to catch style/logic issues
- **TypeScript**: Continuous type checking for type safety
- **Tests**: Run relevant tests on code changes
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Prevent committing broken code

### Development Scripts

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "lint": "next lint",
    "lint:fix": "next lint --fix",
    "type-check": "tsc --noEmit",
    "test": "jest",
    "test:watch": "jest --watch",
    "check-all": "npm run type-check && npm run lint && npm run test"
  }
}
```

### Git Hooks Setup

- **Pre-commit**: Run linting and type checks on staged files
- **Pre-push**: Run full test suite
- **Tools**: Husky + lint-staged for automated workflow

### IDE Integration

- **VS Code settings**: Auto-fix on save, format on save
- **Extensions**: ESLint, TypeScript, Prettier
- **Real-time feedback**: Immediate error highlighting

## 🔄 Development Principles

### Extensibility Focus

- Keep components modular and reusable
- Design data structures for future features
- Use composition over inheritance
- Plan for offline-first architecture

### Performance Considerations

- Lazy load components where possible
- Debounce search and auto-save
- Optimize re-renders with proper memoization
- Consider virtual scrolling for large note lists

### User Experience

- Immediate feedback for all actions
- Graceful error handling
- Intuitive keyboard shortcuts
- Responsive design from the start

## 🛠️ Technical Decisions

### Why This Tech Stack?

- **Next.js**: Future-proof, great PWA support, can add API routes later
- **SlateJS**: Most extensible rich text editor for React
- **Dexie.js**: Clean IndexedDB abstraction from the start
- **React Context → Zustand**: Start simple, upgrade when needed

### Future Extensibility Points

- Plugin architecture for editor features
- Modular storage adapters (local, cloud, sync)
- Component composition for different note types
- Event-driven architecture for feature additions

## 📈 Success Metrics

- [ ] Can create and edit notes reliably
- [ ] App works completely offline
- [ ] Fast search across all notes
- [ ] Intuitive user interface
- [ ] Ready for cloud sync integration
