interface ImageElement {
  type: 'image';
  imageId: string;
  url: string;
  alt?: string;
  caption?: string;
  width?: number;
  height?: number;
  children: [{ text: '' }];
}

// Enhanced notecard with image support
interface Notecard {
  // ... existing fields
  frontImages: string[]; // Array of image asset IDs
  backImages: string[]; // Array of image asset IDs
}
```

## ü§ñ AI Development Workflow

### Node.js Version Management

- **Required version**: Node.js 20+ for Next.js compatibility
- **Check version**: Use `node --version` to confirm correct version is active

### Quality Assurance Protocol

- **Before each commit**: Run `npm run check-all` to verify all quality checks pass
- **Ask before committing**: Always confirm with user before running `git commit`
- **Check off completed tasks**: Update plan.md checkboxes as features are completed
- **Test immediately**: Run relevant tests after implementing new features
- **Write comprehensive tests**: Every new feature should have corresponding tests
- **Minimal mocking**: Use mocks sparingly and only when absolutely necessary
- **Fix, don't mock**: When tests fail, fix the underlying issue rather than mocking it away
- **Never use `any`**: Always use proper TypeScript types - create specific interfaces, union types, or use generics instead of `any`

### Commit Guidelines

- **Small, focused commits**: Each commit should represent one logical change
- **Descriptive messages**: Clear commit messages describing what was implemented
- **Quality gates**: Pre-commit hooks automatically run linting, formatting, and tests
- **User confirmation**: Ask "Ready to commit these changes?" before proceeding

### Progress Tracking

- **Update checkboxes**: Mark completed items as [x] in plan.md
- **Document decisions**: Update technical decisions section when architecture changes
- **Note blockers**: Clearly communicate any issues or dependencies

### Testing Guidelines

- **Test-driven approach**: Write tests for all new functionality
- **Test BEHAVIOR, not INTERFACE**: Tests must verify actual functionality, not just function signatures
  - ‚ùå BAD: `expect(result).toBe(true)` (tests return value)
  - ‚úÖ GOOD: `expect(editor.children[0].type).toBe('bulleted-list')` (tests actual transformation)
  - ‚ùå BAD: `expect(mockFunction).toHaveBeenCalled()` without verifying side effects
  - ‚úÖ GOOD: Verify the actual state changes, DOM updates, or data transformations
- **Real integration tests**: Test actual database operations, not mocked versions
- **Fix configuration issues**: When tests fail due to setup/config, fix the root cause
- **Avoid mock solutions**: Mocks should be used only for external services, not internal logic
- **Test edge cases**: Include error handling, boundary conditions, and failure scenarios
- **Maintain test coverage**: Ensure all critical paths are tested
- **Failing tests first**: When implementing new features, write a failing test that verifies the expected behavior before implementing

### Development Cycle

1. **Write failing test**: Create a test that verifies the expected behavior (should fail initially)
2. **Implement feature**: Write code following our established patterns to make the test pass
3. **Verify behavior**: Ensure tests check actual functionality, not just interfaces
4. **Run quality checks**: `npm run check-all` to verify everything works
5. **Update plan**: Check off completed items in plan.md
6. **Ask user**: "Ready to commit [description of changes]?"
7. **Commit**: Only after user approval

## üîß Development Workflow & Quality

### Automated Quality Checks

- **ESLint**: Run on every file change to catch style/logic issues
- **TypeScript**: Continuous type checking for type safety
- **Tests**: Run relevant tests on code changes
- **Pre-commit hooks**: Prevent committing broken code

### Development Scripts

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "lint": "next lint",
    "lint:fix": "next lint --fix",
    "type-check": "tsc --noEmit",
    "test": "jest",
    "test:watch": "jest --watch",
    "check-all": "npm run type-check && npm run lint && npm run test"
  }
}
```

### Git Hooks Setup

- **Pre-commit**: Run linting and type checks on staged files
- **Pre-push**: Run full test suite
- **Tools**: Husky + lint-staged for automated workflow

### IDE Integration

- **VS Code settings**: Auto-fix on save, format on save
- **Extensions**: ESLint, TypeScript, Prettier
- **Real-time feedback**: Immediate error highlighting

## üîÑ Development Principles
